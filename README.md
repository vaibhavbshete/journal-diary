# Journal Diary (Working Title)

[Visit on Github Pages (Work in Progress)](https://vaibhavbshete.github.io/journal-diary/)

Choose a date (defaults to current date) and start writing. Just text, not even a title. Like your personal feed, that remains personal.

Will have different threads, which you can use to separate the topics of your feeds.

Created mainly out of frustration from trying to use OneNote and Evernote. I just wanted something digital to replace my physical diary. In that I do not need extra features like scanning, text decoration and whatnot. Google Keep came closest to what I needed, but it being Google I was not sure of privacy.

I intend to keep this app's data local, with optional backup to your device's storage.

Since it will be on the device, it won't need you to register or login anywhere, the data will be device-specific.

The only tracking will be to check whether this app has any users, no deeper analytics.
Otherwise this should work as a local-only static app.
